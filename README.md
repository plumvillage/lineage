##Footnote for lineage.csv:

† Zen Master Chân Thật (Chơn Thiệt) was the younger Dharma brother of Zen Master Huệ Minh, so they were both of the 41st Lâm Tế generation. As Zen Master Cương Kỷ passed away when Zen Master Chân Thật was a young novice, it was his elder Dharma brother Zen Master Huệ Minh who transmitted to him the lamp. The Liễu Quán Dharma Line follows lamp transmissions; the Lâm Tế (Linji) School generation is based on ordination.
