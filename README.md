##Footnote for lineage.csv:

† Zen Master Chân Thật (Chơn Thiệt) was the younger Dharma brother of Zen Master Huệ Minh, so they were both of the 41st Lâm Tế generation and the 7th generation of the Liễu Quán Dharma Line. As Zen Master Cương Kỷ passed away when Zen Master Chân Thật was a young novice, it was his elder Dharma brother Zen Master Huệ Minh who transmitted to him the lamp. The Liễu Quán Dharma Line and the Lâm Tế (Linji) School generations are based on ordination, not on lamp transmissions.
